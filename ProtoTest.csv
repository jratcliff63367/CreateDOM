,disableFriction,bool,,,FALSE,,,"If true, then friction is disabled for the material","If this flag is set, friction computations are always skipped between shapes with this material and any other shape."
,disableStrongFriction,bool,,,FALSE,,,If true then strong friction is disabled for the material,The difference between 'normal' and 'strong' friction is that the strong friction feature remembers the 'friction error' between simulation steps.
,dynamicFriction,float,,,0.5,0,FLT_MAX,The coefficient of dynamic friction.,"The coefficient of dynamic friction should be in [0, MAX_F32). If set to greater than staticFriction, the effective value of staticFriction will be increased to match."
,staticFriction,float,,,0.5,0,FLT_MAX,The coefficient of static friction,"The coefficient of dynamic friction should be in [0, PX_MAX_F32). If set to greater than staticFriction, the effective value of staticFriction will be increased to match."
,restitution,float,,,0.5,0,1,The coefficient of resitution.,"A coefficient of 0 makes the object bounce as little as possible, higher values up to 1.0 result in more bounce."
